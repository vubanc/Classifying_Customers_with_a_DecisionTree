# CustomerClassifier_DecisionTree
The objective of this project is to classify customers into different income groups based on their gender, age, spending socre, profession and work experience. The dataset for the project was collected from Kaggle and it contains data from 2000 hypothetical customers. A decision tree has been built from scratch without the help of any machine learning modules. The decision tree was trained on 70% of the data and tested on the remaining 30%.

A decision tree is a machine learning model that contains a tree of nodes or decisions. At each node, the dataset is split into two subsequent nodes. This process is continued untill all the nodes in the tree are pure (the node contains the same kind of samples). The purity of nodes is assessed using entropy or gini index.

Here is a visual representation of the decision tree for the project:
